<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    First off, install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android">WireGuard</a> on the device.

<p>
    After installation you will need to download the config file below directly to the device, or to a PC. <b>This file can only be opened once, so avoid opening it on the wrong device!</b>

<h3>Directly on device</h3>
<p>
    If you have downloaded it directly to the device,<br>
    open the WireGuard app,<br>
    click on the <b><kbd>+</kbd></b> icon<br>
    and select <kbd>Import from file or archive</kbd>.<br>
    Then select the config file you downloaded.

    If you instead have it on a PC,<br>

    then open the WireGuard app,<br>
    click on the <b><kbd>+</kbd></b> icon<br>
    and select <kbd>Create from scratch</kbd>.<br>
    Under <kbd>Interface</kbd> enter as name KeukNet,<br>
    then proceed to enter the rest of the information specified under <code>[Interface]</code>.<br>
